% Blair - October 6, 2033
% Takes in the evt_ECI_TCPIP_55513 variable and returns two vectors. 
% - First vector is the trigger labels, as integers. The original format of
%   the trigger labels in the cell array is assumed to be 'xHz', where 'x'
%   is an integer. Examples: '3Hz ' (yes with the space), '10Hz'.
% - Second vector is all onsets at the original sampling rate (usually 
%   1 kHz). 
% Both returned vectors are in column form.

% Function history
% - Adapted from parseTCP, 10/6/2022
% - parseTCP adapted from parseDIN Blair May 6 2014

% The structure of the input variable is as follows:
% - It's a cell array of size 4 x nTriggers
% - Row 1 contains the triggers (strings)
% - Row 2 contains the onset times (probably in msec)
% - Row 3 is something (all 1's right now)
% - Row 4 contains the onset times (probably in samples). When the data are
%   exported with no downsampling, this row is the same as row 2. We have
%   found in the past (with the DIN matrix) that when data are exported
%   WITH downsampling, this row is floor(row2/D), so it's better to compute
%   the downsampled onset times by hand from row 2, e.g., round(row2/D).

% Get all the triggers from the first row of TCP
allTriggers = cell2mat(cellfun(@(x) sscanf(x, '%d'), ...
    tcpip(1,:), 'UniformOutput', false));
allTriggers = allTriggers(:);

% Get all onsets from second row of TCP
allOnsets = cell2mat(tcpip(2,:));
allOnsets = allOnsets(:);
