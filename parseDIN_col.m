% ------------------------------------------------
% Blair - May 6, 2014
% Takes in the DIN_1 variable and returns two vectors. First vector is all
% trigger labels (as integers); second vector is all onsets at the original
% sampling rate (usually 1 kHz).
%
% This function is identical to the parseDIN function, except that the
% output vectors are in column rather than row form.
