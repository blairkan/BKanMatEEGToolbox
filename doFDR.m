function h = doFDR(pvals, q)
% h = doFDR(pvals, q)
% ---------------------------------------------------
% From Jacek - April 22, 2016 (was fdr.m)
% This script takes in a vector of p-values from multiple significance
% tests and a desired FDR level (analogous to alpha; optional), and outputs
% an array the same size as the input indicating the corrected hypothesis
% test results.
%
% Inputs
% - pvals: p-values of your multiple significance tests
% - q: Desired FDR level (like alpha) -- defaults to 0.05
%
% Output
% - h: Array of size(pvals) indicating the corrected hypothesis test 
% results: 1 indicates a rejected null hypothesis
